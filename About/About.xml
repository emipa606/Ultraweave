--- Original Description ---
Adds in Ultraweave. Ultraweave is simply highly pressurised Hyperweave formed together in a way that appears nigh-unbreakable. Used by Glittertech worlds to shield their vitals. This material is renowned for its temperature resilience. It resembles diamond in both look and molecular shape. It is almost uncuttable.

This is an OP mod that adds in a material formed from Hyperweave. Currently it takes 15 Hyperweave to make at a Machining Bench. No research is required.

Yes this is OP. I made it so that I had a strong material to test mods on for my Youtube channel, a viewer asked me to upload it so here it is! I have no intention of balancing it, or even changing the mod much. Thanks to Sera for the artwork.

This should work with all mods, and also should be save-game compatible. It doesn't change any core items.

My Youtube Channel is here if you want to see the material in action during my Mod Showcases: https://www.youtube.com/c/barky</description>
